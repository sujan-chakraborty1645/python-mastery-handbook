# Python Generators

An in-depth guide to Python generators - a powerful tool for efficient iteration and memory management.

## Introduction to Generators

Generators are a special type of iterator in Python that allow you to declare a function that behaves like an iterator. They provide an elegant way to produce a sequence of values without storing the entire sequence in memory.

Generators are particularly valuable when working with large datasets or infinite sequences, as they generate values on-the-fly instead of precomputing and storing them.

## Generator Functions vs. Regular Functions

A generator function looks like a regular function but uses the `yield` keyword instead of `return` to provide a result to the caller. While a regular function returns once, a generator function can yield multiple times, pausing execution and resuming from where it left off when next called.

```python
# Regular function - returns once
def get_numbers_list(n):
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        result.append(i)
    return result

# Generator function - yields values one at a time
def get_numbers_generator(n):
    for i in range(n):
        yield i

# Using the regular function (creates full list in memory)
numbers_list = get_numbers_list(1000000)  # Creates a list with 1M elements

# Using the generator function (creates values on demand)
numbers_gen = get_numbers_generator(1000000)  # Creates only a generator object
for num in numbers_gen:  # Values are generated one at a time
    if num > 10:
        break  # Only first 11 numbers are actually generated
```

## Creating Generators

### 1. Generator Functions

The simplest way to create a generator is by defining a function that uses the `yield` statement:

```python
def countdown(n):
    print("Countdown starting!")
    while n > 0:
        yield n
        n -= 1
    print("Liftoff!")

# Using the generator
for i in countdown(5):
    print(i)

# Output:
# Countdown starting!
# 5
# 4
# 3
# 2
# 1
# Liftoff!
```

### 2. Generator Expressions

Similar to list comprehensions, Python supports generator expressions for compact, one-line generators:

```python
# List comprehension - creates entire list in memory
squares_list = [x*x for x in range(1000)]

# Generator expression - creates values on demand
squares_gen = (x*x for x in range(1000))
```

The primary difference is the use of parentheses `()` instead of brackets `[]`. The generator expression doesn't compute all values immediately - it waits until they're requested.

## How Generators Work

When you call a generator function, it doesn't run immediately. Instead, it returns a generator object that supports the iterator protocol:

```python
def simple_generator():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3

# Create a generator object
gen = simple_generator()

# Generator doesn't execute until we iterate
print(next(gen))  # Prints: 1
print(next(gen))  # Prints: 2
print(next(gen))  # Prints: 3
print(next(gen))  # Raises StopIteration exception
```

Each call to `next()` executes the generator code until the next `yield` statement. The generator's state is saved, allowing it to resume from where it left off. When there are no more values to yield, a `StopIteration` exception is raised.

## State Preservation

A key feature of generators is that they maintain their state between calls:

```python
def counter():
    i = 0
    while True:
        i += 1
        command = yield i
        if command == "reset":
            i = 0

c = counter()
print(next(c))     # 1
print(next(c))     # 2
print(c.send("reset"))  # Resets and returns 1
print(next(c))     # 2 again
```

## Generator Methods

Generators support several special methods for controlling their execution:

### 1. `next(generator)` or `generator.__next__()`

Advances the generator to the next yield statement and returns the yielded value.

```python
def simple_gen():
    yield "First"
    yield "Second"
    yield "Third"

g = simple_gen()
print(next(g))  # "First"
print(next(g))  # "Second"
print(next(g))  # "Third"
```

### 2. `generator.send(value)`

Resumes the generator and sends a value that becomes the result of the current `yield` expression:

```python
def echo_generator():
    response = yield "Ready for input"
    while True:
        response = yield f"You said: {response}"

gen = echo_generator()
print(next(gen))     # "Ready for input" (advances to first yield)
print(gen.send("Hello"))  # "You said: Hello"
print(gen.send("World"))  # "You said: World"
```

### 3. `generator.throw(exception)`

Resumes the generator and raises an exception at the current `yield` expression:

```python
def handle_exception():
    try:
        yield "Normal operation"
        yield "Still normal"
    except ValueError:
        yield "Caught ValueError"
    yield "Continuing after exception"

g = handle_exception()
print(next(g))           # "Normal operation"
print(g.throw(ValueError("An error")))  # "Caught ValueError"
print(next(g))           # "Continuing after exception"
```

### 4. `generator.close()`

Closes the generator, raising a `GeneratorExit` exception at the current `yield` expression:

```python
def cleanup_example():
    try:
        yield "First value"
        yield "Second value"
    except GeneratorExit:
        print("Generator is being closed!")
        # Perform cleanup operations
    yield "This will never be reached if closed"

g = cleanup_example()
print(next(g))  # "First value"
g.close()       # Prints "Generator is being closed!" and doesn't return anything
```

## Generator Pipelines

Generators can be connected in pipelines, where the output of one generator is fed into another. This is a powerful pattern for data processing:

```python
def read_file(filename):
    """Generator that yields lines from a file"""
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            yield line.strip()

def grep(pattern, lines):
    """Generator that yields lines matching a pattern"""
    for line in lines:
        if pattern in line:
            yield line

def uppercase(lines):
    """Generator that yields uppercase versions of input lines"""
    for line in lines:
        yield line.upper()

# Pipeline: read file -> filter lines -> convert to uppercase
file_lines = read_file('example.txt')
filtered_lines = grep('important', file_lines)
uppercase_lines = uppercase(filtered_lines)

for line in uppercase_lines:
    print(line)
```

This approach is memory-efficient and allows processing large files that wouldn't fit in memory.

## Infinite Sequences with Generators

Generators excel at representing infinite sequences, as they only compute values when needed:

```python
def infinite_counter(start=0):
    """Generate an infinite sequence of incrementing numbers"""
    num = start
    while True:
        yield num
        num += 1

# You can use it safely with take(), islice(), or a break condition
counter = infinite_counter()
for i, num in enumerate(counter):
    print(num)
    if i >= 9:  # Only take first 10 numbers
        break
```

## Fibonacci Sequence Example

A classic example of generators is implementing the Fibonacci sequence:

```python
def fibonacci():
    """Generate an infinite Fibonacci sequence"""
    a, b = 0, 1
    while True:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

# Get first 10 Fibonacci numbers
fib = fibonacci()
for i, num in enumerate(fib):
    if i >= 10:
        break
    print(f"Fibonacci {i}: {num}")
```

## Generator Delegation with `yield from`

Python 3.3+ introduced the `yield from` syntax, which delegates part of a generator's operations to another generator:

```python
def subgenerator():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3

def delegating_generator():
    yield 'Start'
    yield from subgenerator()  # Delegates to subgenerator
    yield 'End'

# Using the delegating generator
for item in delegating_generator():
    print(item)
# Output:
# Start
# 1
# 2
# 3
# End
```

This is especially useful for composing generators and implementing recursive generators:

```python
def traverse_directory(path):
    """Recursively yield all files in a directory tree"""
    for item in os.listdir(path):
        item_path = os.path.join(path, item)
        if os.path.isfile(item_path):
            yield item_path
        else:
            yield from traverse_directory(item_path)  # Recurse into subdirectories
```

## Memory Efficiency: Generators vs Lists

To demonstrate the memory efficiency of generators, let's compare memory usage:

```python
import sys

# List comprehension (stores all values in memory)
big_list = [i for i in range(1000000)]
print(f"List size: {sys.getsizeof(big_list)} bytes")

# Generator expression (stores only the generator object)
big_gen = (i for i in range(1000000))
print(f"Generator size: {sys.getsizeof(big_gen)} bytes")
```

The list requires memory proportional to its length, while the generator requires only a fixed small amount regardless of how many items it will produce.

## Practical Applications

### 1. Processing Large Files

```python
def process_large_file(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        for line in f:  # File objects are also generators in Python
            yield line.strip()

for line in process_large_file('huge_log.txt'):
    if "ERROR" in line:
        print(f"Found error: {line}")
```

### 2. Database Record Processing

```python
def fetch_records(query, batch_size=1000):
    """Fetch database records in batches to avoid memory issues"""
    offset = 0
    while True:
        records = db.execute(f"{query} LIMIT {batch_size} OFFSET {offset}")
        if not records:
            break
        for record in records:
            yield record
        offset += batch_size

for record in fetch_records("SELECT * FROM large_table"):
    process_record(record)
```

### 3. Data Transformation Pipeline

```python
def extract_data(source):
    """Extract data from source"""
    for item in source:
        yield parse_item(item)

def transform_data(data):
    """Transform data"""
    for item in data:
        yield transform_item(item)

def load_data(data, destination):
    """Load data to destination"""
    for item in data:
        save_item(item, destination)
        yield item  # Pass through for potential chaining

# ETL pipeline
raw_data = get_data_source()
extracted = extract_data(raw_data)
transformed = transform_data(extracted)
load_data(transformed, destination)
```

## Custom Iteration with Generators

Generators make it simple to create custom iteration patterns:

```python
def alternating_items(*iterables):
    """Yields items from iterables in alternating order"""
    iterators = [iter(it) for it in iterables]
    active = True
    while active:
        active = False
        for iterator in iterators:
            try:
                yield next(iterator)
                active = True
            except StopIteration:
                pass

# Example usage
for item in alternating_items([1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c']):
    print(item)
# Output: 1, 'a', 2, 'b', 3, 'c'
```

## Generators in Asynchronous Programming

In Python 3.6+, generators evolved into coroutines with the introduction of `async`/`await`, enabling asynchronous programming:

```python
import asyncio

async def async_generator():
    for i in range(3):
        await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Non-blocking sleep
        yield i

async def main():
    async for item in async_generator():
        print(item)

# Run the async code
asyncio.run(main())
```

## Performance Considerations

### When to Use Generators:
- Working with large datasets that might not fit in memory
- Processing items one at a time in a pipeline
- Representing potentially infinite sequences
- Improving memory usage in data processing tasks

### When to Use Lists:
- When you need random access to elements
- When you need to use the sequence multiple times
- When you need the length of the sequence immediately
- When you want to use methods like sort() that require the whole sequence

## Best Practices for Generators

1. **Use generators for large or infinite sequences**
   ```python
   # Good - memory efficient
   def read_large_file(file_path):
       with open(file_path) as f:
           for line in f:
               yield line.strip()
   ```

2. **Prefer generator expressions for simple transformations**
   ```python
   # Good - concise and clear
   uppercase_names = (name.upper() for name in names)
   ```

3. **Use `yield from` for delegation**
   ```python
   # Good - clean delegation
   def combined_generators():
       yield from gen1()
       yield from gen2()
   ```

4. **Add docstrings explaining the generated sequence**
   ```python
   def primes():
       """Generate an infinite sequence of prime numbers."""
       # Implementation...
   ```

5. **Handle cleanup with try/finally**
   ```python
   def resource_generator():
       resource = acquire_resource()
       try:
           yield from process_with_resource(resource)
       finally:
           release_resource(resource)
   ```

## Common Patterns and Idioms

### Chunking data with generators

```python
def chunked(iterable, n):
    """Yield successive n-sized chunks from iterable"""
    it = iter(iterable)
    while True:
        chunk = list(itertools.islice(it, n))
        if not chunk:
            return
        yield chunk

# Process a large list in chunks of 100
for chunk in chunked(huge_list, 100):
    process_chunk(chunk)
```

### Sliding window

```python
def sliding_window(iterable, n):
    """Yield sliding windows of width n from iterable"""
    it = iter(iterable)
    window = collections.deque(itertools.islice(it, n), maxlen=n)
    if len(window) < n:
        return
    yield tuple(window)
    for item in it:
        window.append(item)
        yield tuple(window)

# Example: Find patterns in consecutive elements
for window in sliding_window([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 3):
    print(window)
# Output: (1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4), (3, 4, 5), (4, 5, 6)
```
